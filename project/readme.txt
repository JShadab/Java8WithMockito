My Idee of a Project to understand Functional Programming in Java and Mockito



1. There is a List of students. Each Student have firstName, lastName, gender, age and Nationality

2. Write a Java method to get the SET of countries of birth of all these students and a JUnit test for it

3. Write a Java method to filter the youngest female student and a JUnit test for it

4. Write a Java method to filter the youngest male student and a JUnit test for it

5. Write a Java method to filter the oldest male student in a class and a JUnit test for it

6. Write a Java method to filter Students with the same firstName and a JUnit

7. Every student has a method called doHomework(), and in this method, it calls teacher.rateHomework().

8. The teacher is another object, of course. Write a JUnit method to test this behavior.

9. Inside the method, you should mock teacher.rateHomework() using Mockito



Java 8 Features, Lambda Expressions, Stream API, etc and JUnit with Mockito Framework
