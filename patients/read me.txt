We have patients in hospital. We know their diagnoses (each can have several) 
and test performed (I coll that test Analyses, maybe not best name) Each analysis can be positive or negative.

Main purpose is to determine which analysis predict diagnose.

In my case analysis predict diagnoses if more people have same analysis result that don't.

Also i have dummy data generator.

List of diagnoses configured in clinic.repository.Diagnoses

list of possible analysis in clinic.repository.Analyzes

Data generator in clinic.repository.Patients

All together can be runned from clinic.CorrelationsAnalysesIntegrationTest


Some utils I need. some common functions to work with streams and Tuple class which is basically pair of values.

Of course such approach is weak from statistical point of view, but it is not what I want to demonstrate.
